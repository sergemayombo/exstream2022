# exstream2022
All data generated from the exstream2022 experiment and their analyses are stored in this repository. These data will be used for a manuscript to be submitted for publication in the CRC RESIST 1439 STOTEN special issue.This study involved testing the response of microphytobenthic communities to multiple stressors (salinity, temperature and flow velocity) in the Boye catchment using a MINI PAM II for estimating microalgal photosynthetic biomass, digital light microscopy and 18S-V9 amplicon sequencing for analysing their community structures.
